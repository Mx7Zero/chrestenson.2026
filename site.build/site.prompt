- Nav items: About | Expertise | Work | Contact (smooth scroll anchors)
- CTA Button: "Book a Call" → opens Calendly embed/link
- Mobile: Hamburger menu with slide-in panel

### 2. HERO SECTION
**Layout:** Full viewport height, centered content, minimal

**Content:**
```

### 3. CREDIBILITY BAR (Social Proof)
**Layout:** Horizontal scroll on mobile, grid on desktop

**Content:** Logo/text badges for past work:
```
Disney | National Geographic | Ridley Scott Associates

**Headline:** "Not AI-literate. AI-native."

**Body Copy:**

Unique combination of studio-grade production experience (Disney, National Geographic, 
Ridley Scott Associates), hospitality brand-building (six successful ventures from

asset creation at enterprise scale—work that previously required teams, now executed 
with AI-assisted workflows.

- Whitespace is premium. Don't crowd sections.
- All text from Job Skills 2026 document must be included.
- The site should feel like a tech founder's personal site—confident, minimal, substance over flash.
- Test on iPhone and Android before deploying.
- Run Lighthouse audit and fix any issues before going live.

**Build this site. Make it exceptional.**
